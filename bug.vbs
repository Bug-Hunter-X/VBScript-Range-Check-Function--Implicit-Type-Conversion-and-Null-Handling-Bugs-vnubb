Function to check if a number is within a range in VBScript:

```vbscript
Function IsWithinRange(number, min, max)
  If number >= min And number <= max Then
    IsWithinRange = True
  Else
    IsWithinRange = False
  End If
End Function
```

**Bug:** The function works correctly for most cases but will fail if the input number is a string that can be implicitly converted to a number.  This can lead to unexpected results and silent errors.

**Example:**
```vbscript
MsgBox IsWithinRange("10", 1, 100) ' Returns True (Unexpected)
```

Here, "10" is treated as a number 10, which is indeed within the range. But this is a potential error because the function does not explicitly check for the input type.  If the string cannot be implicitly converted (e.g., "abc"), a type mismatch error will occur.

**Another bug:** The function does not handle null or empty values gracefully. This will cause a type mismatch error if these values are passed in as the 'number' argument.
